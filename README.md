# Kaggle

This repo  hosts my ipython notebooks of Kaggle competition:

(https://www.kaggle.com/c/hashcode-drone-delivery/data?select=hashcode_delivery_instructions.pdf)

## Problem statement

In this competition, you are given a hypothetical fleet of drones, a list of customer orders, and availability of the individual products in warehouses. Can you schedule the drone operations so that the orders are completed as soon as possible?

## My solution

I modelled the problem as one of **assignment problem** in which **warehouses** serve as **sources** & **Delivery location** as **destinations**
### Optimisation objective:
Minimise total path cost of drones

## Algorithm Used:
Minimum cost flow algorithm in networks
